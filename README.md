**MySQL User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF)**

This document provides instructions for compiling, installing, and using the custom MySQL User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF). This UDAF is implemented in C++ and can be used to perform specialized aggregate operations in MySQL.

**Prerequisites**
* MySQL server installed and running
* C++ compiler (g++) with support for shared library compilation
* Development files for MySQL (MySQL header files)
* GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) installed

**Compilation**
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory containing the C++ source file (file_name.cpp).
* Compile the source file using the following command: **g++ file_name.cpp -fPIC -lgmp -shared -o /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/file_name.so -I /usr/include/mysql**

**Installing the UDAF in MySQL**
* Launch the MySQL server and log in using a user account with sufficient privileges to create functions.
* Create the UDAF in MySQL by executing the following SQL command: **CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION Function_Name RETURNS STRING SONAME 'file_name.so';** (In Place of STRING, We can use REAL for Double/Integer return values.)
* Replace Function_Name with the desired name for your UDAF and file_name.so with the actual name of your compiled shared object file.

**Usage**
* Once the UDAF is created, you can use it in your SQL queries to perform aggregate operations on the data. For example: **SELECT Function_Name(column_name) FROM your_table GROUP BY another_column;**
* Replace column_name with the name of the column you want to aggregate, your_table with the name of your table, and another_column with the column you want to group by.

**Notes**
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create functions in MySQL and to write to the MySQL plugin directory.
* The path to the MySQL plugin directory (/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/) may vary depending on your MySQL installation and operating system. Adjust the paths accordingly.
